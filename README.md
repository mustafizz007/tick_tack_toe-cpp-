# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. The game is played by two players, who take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row or  wins the diagonally game.

# To play

- Build and run the program on any compiler (codeblocks is preferred).
- Enter the names of the two players.
- Each player will take turns choosing a number (1-9) to place their mark on the grid. The numbers correspond to the positions on the grid, as shown below:

 - player 1 goes first &  places "X" on the grid.
 - player 2 goes second & places "O" on the grid.
 - The game will continue until one player gets three of their marks in a row, in a diagonal or all nine positions are filled.

 # Invalid Input Handling

 - A player enters an invalid input ( a number that is not between 1 and 9 ), the program will print "Invalid Move go again", & ask the current player to go gain  ( input again i.e. an ideal input ).
